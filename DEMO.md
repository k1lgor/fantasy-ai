## 1. Chip Strategy & Schedule
- **Remaining Chips**: `["wildcard", "freehit", "bboost", "3xc"]`
- **Double/Blank GW Alerts**:
  - 🚨 UPCOMING CALENDAR DGW: EVE plays 2 times in week of 19 Jan [BOU (GW21), ARS (GW22)]
  - ⚠️ FUTURE CALENDAR DGW: MCI plays 2 times in week of 02 Feb [TOT (GW24), WOL (GW25)]
- **Strategy Code**: SAVE
- **Reasoning**: All chips have reset for the second half of the season; holding for larger Double Gameweeks later in the spring is optimal.

## 3. Captaincy Outlook (Next 3 GWs)

1. **Haaland (MCI)**:
   - **Upside**: Elite goal-scoring record and secure minutes.
   - **Fixture**: CRY (H), BOU (A), EVE (H).
   - **Reasoning**: Highest ceiling in the game; MCI form is peaking.
2. **Foden (MCI)**:
   - **Upside**: High `xGI90` and `BCI90`.
   - **Fixture**: Same as Haaland.
   - **Reasoning**: Perfect differential vice-captain; in "Rising Star" territory.

## 4. Transfer Recommendations

**Aggressiveness Level**: BALANCED
**Hit Budget**: Authorized for 1 hit (-4) if necessary to secure a Rising Star.

### Priority 1: Injured/Unavailable Players

- **OUT**: Muñoz (CRY, £5.0M)
- **IN**: Tarkowski (EVE, £5.4M)
- **Net Cost**: -£0.4M (from bank)
- **Estimated Points Gain vs Hit Cost**: +6.0 pts / 0 cost = Infinite ROI.

### Priority 2: FLOPS OUT / RISING STARS IN

- **RISING STAR ALERT**: **Foden (MCI)** (Form: 11.5) meets Condition A (Last 3 GWs ≥ 18 pts).
- **RISING STAR ALERT**: **Dewsbury-Hall (EVE)** (Form: 9.8) meets Condition C (Form > 6.0 and High `xGI90`).
- **FLOP ALERT**: **Minteh (BHA)** (Form: 1.2) meets Condition A (Last 3 GWs ≤ 6 pts). Recommend selling for **B. Fernandes (MUN)** soon.

---

## 5. Optimized 15-Man Squad

- **GKs**: Pickford (EVE), Petrović (BOU)
- **DEFs**: Tarkowski (EVE) 🚨, Guéhi (CRY), O’Reilly (MCI), Alderete (SUN), J. Timber (ARS) ⚠️
- **MIDs**: Foden (MCI) ⭐, Dewsbury-Hall (EVE) ⭐, B. Fernandes (MUN), Bruno G. (NEW), Gibbs-White (NFO)
- **FWDs**: Haaland (MCI) (C), Thiago (BRE), Calvert-Lewin (LEE)

---

## 6. Best Starting XI & Formation

**Formation: 3-5-2**

- **GK**: Pickford (EVE)
- **DEF**: Tarkowski (EVE), Guéhi (CRY), O’Reilly (MCI)
- **MID**: Foden (MCI), Dewsbury-Hall (EVE), B. Fernandes (MUN), Bruno G. (NEW), Gibbs-White (NFO)
- **FWD**: Haaland (MCI) (C), Thiago (BRE) (VC)

**Bench Order**:

1. Calvert-Lewin (LEE) - Strong rotation if attackers fail.
2. J. Timber (ARS) - Risky minutes this week.
3. Alderete (SUN) - Emergency cover.
4. Petrović (BOU) - Backup GK.

---

## 7. Key Insights & Risks

- **Injury Impact**: Muñoz is a forced sell; Tarkowski provides immediate cover and a DGW upside.
- **Fixture Swings**: EVE has a massive fixture swing and an upcoming calendar DGW.
- **Rotation Risk**: MCI assets (Foden) always carry slight risk, but current form makes them essential.
- **Differentials**: Dewsbury-Hall is a high-value differential with elite underlying metrics.

## 8. Final Decision Summary (MANDATORY TABLE)

| Transfers         | Hits | Captain | Formation | Key Risk              | Expected Outcome |
| :---------------- | :--- | :------ | :-------- | :-------------------- | :--------------- |
| Muñoz → Tarkowski | 0    | Haaland | 3-5-2     | Timber/Mateta Minutes | +12.5 EV         |

---

## 9. Contingency Plan

- **Emergency Pivot**: If Mateta joins Muñoz on the sideline, sell Mateta for Calvert-Lewin (LEE) or Thiago (BRE) if not already owned.
- **Timber Backup**: If Timber is confirmed OUT, Alderete starts automatically from the bench.
